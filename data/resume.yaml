    description: |
      My job at Kabisa fits me like a glove. I greatly enjoy working among
      like-minded people who care about the services they offer and products
      they provide.

      At Kabisa I have spent most of my time working as a consultant. Being a
      consultant allows me to have multitudes of experiences. This means I can
      do what I like most: learning new things.
